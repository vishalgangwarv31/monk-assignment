# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, WebStorm)

## Cloning the Repository
```sh
gh repo clone vishalgangwarv31/monk-assignment
cd monk-assignment
```

## Setting Up the Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Setting Up the Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

## Running the Project
To run both the frontend and backend simultaneously in separate code editors:

1. **Frontend**
   - Open the `frontend` folder in a code editor.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Backend**
   - Open the `backend` folder in a separate code editor.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

The project should now be running with both the frontend and backend active.
